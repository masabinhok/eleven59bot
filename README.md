# Eleven59 Bot

Eleven59 is a Discord bot designed to help you manage your deadlines. The bot allows users to add deadlines, receive reminders about upcoming deadlines, and track tasks efficiently within a Discord server.

## Features

- **Add Deadlines:** Users can add deadlines with specific subjects, dates, and tasks.
- **Reminders:** The bot will send reminders when a task is due within the next 24 hours.
- **Overdue Notifications:** Once a task is overdue, the bot will notify the server and automatically remove the deadline.
- **Task Management:** Automatically deletes deadlines after notifying users of overdue tasks.

## Commands

### Add a Deadline
```bash
/deadline [subject] [date] [task]
```
- **subject**: The subject or category of the deadline (e.g., "Math" or "Project").
- **date**: The due date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- **task**: The description of the task to be completed.
  
Example:
```
/deadline Math 2024-09-30 Finish the algebra assignment
```
The bot will respond with:
```
üìÖ Deadline added for Math on 2024-09-30: Finish the algebra assignment
```

### Automatic Reminders
- The bot will check for deadlines every 24 hours.
- Reminds users of tasks that are due within the next 24 hours with the `@everyone` tag.

### Overdue Task Notifications
- If a task is overdue, the bot will notify the server with the following message:
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è [subject] task was due on [date]: [task] hope you submitted it!üòâ
  ```
- The bot will automatically remove the overdue task from the database.
